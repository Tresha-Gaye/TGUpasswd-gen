# Password Generator

This application creates a secure, random password generator to provide greater security for employees who have access to sensitive data.

The primary directive was guide the user to choose among certain criteria in order to generate a ramdom password of a length they choose.

The first version of this password had several bugs, which included inability to generate a password of the requested length and to return the password after the user selected their criteria.

These bugs were addressed in this version, and the user should be able to generate a random password containing lowercase and/or uppercase and/or numbers and/or special characters of a length between 8 and 128 characters.
